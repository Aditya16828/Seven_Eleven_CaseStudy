# Description
7-Eleven is one of the world's major retail stores with a strong presence in US as well. But currently, the company has a problem with understanding demand patterns which leads to inventory and budget allocation related issues. In order to address the same, the company has tasked us with devising a model which can predict the upcoming demand (sales) in a fairly accurate manner. 

The data consists of sales for 45 country-wide stores located in different regions.

7-Eleven runs promotions throughtout the year which include Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
